# Privacy

FrostPi contains no telemetry, analytics, advertising, account system, or remote service of its own.

FrostPi persists only local session metadata in VS Code workspace state: FrostPi session id, title, workspace path, Pi session-file path, last-update time, and active session id. It does not persist prompt bodies, responses, reasoning, tool output, pasted images, API keys, or provider credentials. Optional proxy authentication is stored separately in VS Code SecretStorage.

Prompts, images, tool calls, and model requests are sent to the locally launched Pi process. Pi and the configured model provider may store or process that data under their own settings and policies. FrostPi does not alter those data flows. Opening Provider Usage separately reads Pi's saved provider configuration and available environment credentials in the workspace Extension Host, then queries the matching official usage endpoints. This read-only feature does not refresh tokens or modify credentials. Only usage results reach the Webview; snapshots are cached in memory and are not persisted. They may describe a different account from model-specific or extension-injected session authentication.

Rendered conversation content cannot contact remote servers: the Webview loads only packaged resources and in-memory image data. A remote HTTPS image in a message stays a placeholder until you choose `Load image`. The Extension Host then requests that one URL, without cookies, credentials or a referrer and through the configured FrostPi proxy, so the image's server sees a request from the machine running the Extension Host.

A diagnostic export contains extension/runtime versions, session status, session titles, paths, counts, and bounded errors. Prompt and response content are intentionally excluded, and common token/password/bearer/URL credentials are redacted. Text that Pi or its extensions print to stderr is not exported, only its size, because it can hold prompts, file contents or credentials that no redaction recognizes. Review diagnostics before sharing because paths, session titles and error messages may still contain sensitive information.
